# Purr4Furr: A Dating App for the Furry Community üêæ

## Inspiration

The furry community is a vibrant, diverse group of individuals who share a passion for anthropomorphic art, characters, and self-expression through their "fursonas" (furry personas). Despite being a close-knit community, furries often struggle to find meaningful connections on mainstream dating platforms that don't understand or accommodate their unique culture and identity.

We were inspired by the need for a **safe, inclusive, and understanding space** where furries could connect with like-minded individuals who share their interests, values, and lifestyle. Traditional dating apps often lead to awkward explanations or judgment when furries try to express their authentic selves. We wanted to create a platform where users could be proudly and openly furry from day one.

The name "Purr4Furr" embodies the warmth and affection ("purr") that we wanted to foster within our furry ("furr") community.

## What it does

Purr4Furr is a **comprehensive mobile dating application** specifically designed for the furry community, built with React Native and Expo. The app provides:

- **Community-Centric Profiles**: Comprehensive profile system including pronouns, identity, interests, and furry-specific preferences
- **Inclusive Identity Options**: Support for diverse gender identities, sexual orientations, and relationship preferences
- **Interest Matching**: Filter and match based on shared furry interests and community involvement

### Technical Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Row-level security and user authentication
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, intuitive interface that works across different screen sizes

## How we built it

### Technology Stack
Our development approach focused on creating a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application:

**Frontend:**
- **React Native with Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code maintainability  
- **Expo Router**: For seamless navigation and routing
- **React Native Reanimated**: For smooth animations and interactions

**Backend & Database:**
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensuring user data privacy and security
- **Supabase Auth**: Secure user authentication and session management

**State Management:**
- **React Context API**: For global state management across dating, authentication, and user preferences
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic and clean component architecture

### Database Architecture
We designed a comprehensive database schema to support the furry dating experience:

```sql
-- Core user profiles with furry-specific fields
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  fursona TEXT,
  gender TEXT NOT NULL,
  sexuality TEXT NOT NULL,
  interested_in TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  dating_intentions TEXT NOT NULL,
  interests TEXT[],
  -- ... and many more furry-specific fields
);

-- Sophisticated matching system
CREATE TABLE likes (
  liker_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  liked_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  is_mutual BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE matches (
  user1_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  user2_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);
```

### Development Process
1. **User Research**: Studied existing dating apps and furry community needs
2. **Database Design**: Created comprehensive schema supporting furry identity
3. **Component Architecture**: Built reusable, themed components for consistent UI
4. **State Management**: Implemented context providers for authentication, dating, and messaging
5. **Real-time Features**: Integrated Supabase for live updates and messaging
6. **Testing & Iteration**: Continuous testing and refinement based on user feedback

## Challenges we ran into

### Technical Challenges

**1. Complex State Management**
Managing interconnected state between authentication, user preferences, matches, and real-time messaging required careful architecture. We solved this by implementing multiple specialized Context providers:
```typescript
// Coordinated multiple contexts for different app domains
<AuthProvider>
  <DatingProvider>
    <LikesProvider>
      {/* App components */}
    </LikesProvider>
  </DatingProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

**2. Real-time Messaging Architecture**
Implementing real-time messaging with proper state synchronization between matched users proved complex. We needed to ensure:
- Message delivery confirmation
- Read receipts
- Proper state updates across different app screens

**3. Asset Management & Metro Bundler Issues**
We encountered significant challenges with React Native's Metro bundler cache system when managing image assets. The bundler continued looking for outdated asset references even after configuration updates, requiring us to:
- Implement proper asset fallback strategies
- Create comprehensive asset management system
- Clear bundler cache and ensure all referenced assets exist

**4. Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Ensuring consistent behavior across iOS and Android required careful attention to platform-specific navigation, keyboard handling, and UI components.

### User Experience Challenges

**5. Inclusive Profile Creation**
Designing a profile system that captures the full spectrum of furry identity while remaining intuitive was challenging. We needed to balance comprehensive options with usability:
- Multiple identity fields (gender, sexuality, fursona, interests)
- Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming new users
- Flexible input validation for diverse user needs

**6. Privacy and Safety**
Creating a safe space for a community that often faces discrimination required implementing robust privacy controls and content moderation strategies.
